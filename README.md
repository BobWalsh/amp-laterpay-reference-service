# AMP prototype

This project is a very simple demo of an AMP page using [amp-access](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/extended/amp-access.html)
to demonstrate how to allow access to an article through a buying process.

## Running it locally

This prototype uses a very simple demo server written in Node.js to provide
some mock responses with the necessary headers and expected redirection patterns.

Make sure you have a recent Node.js (stable or LTS) and then:

```
npm install
npm start
```
